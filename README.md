# Biogeography-of-hot-spring-photosynthetic-microbial-biofilms-in-Southeast-Asia
R codes to process raw DNA sequences obtained from photosynthetic biofilms sampled along 40 hotsprings in Southeast Asia.

Refer to the Methods and Supplementary information of the paper. 

These R codes are split into 2 files and are  used to process raw DNA sequecnes obtained from the Novaseq 6000 platform:PE250 (paired end 250bp), analyze and visualize the  processed data.

Codes in first file, titled '1.RawSeqs_to_Phyloseq_short.R' was used to process raw DNA sequences and eventually generates rarefied and filtered phyloseqs. 

Codes in the second file, titled '2.Data_visualization.R' was used to process the rarefied and filtered phyloseqs for data visualization and statitical analyses.
